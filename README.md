1. **Linear Regression**: It's a statistical method that is used for predictive analysis. It establishes a relationship between dependent and independent variable with a best fit line.

2. **Logistic Regression**: It's a classification algorithm used to predict a binary outcome (1 / 0, Yes / No, True / False) given a set of independent variables.

3. **Decision Trees**: It's a type of supervised learning algorithm that is mostly used for classification problems. It works for both categorical and continuous input and output variables.

4. **Random Forest**: It's a type of ensemble learning method, where a group of weak models combine to form a powerful model.

5. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: It's a simple algorithm that stores all available cases and classifies new cases based on a similarity measure.

6. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: It's a classification method. In this algorithm, we plot each data item as a point in n-dimensional space (where n is the number of features you have) with the value of each feature being the value of a particular coordinate.

7. **Naive Bayes**: It's a classification technique based on Bayes' theorem with an assumption of independence between predictors.

8. **Neural Networks**: These are a set of algorithms, modeled loosely after the human brain, that are designed to recognize patterns.

9. **Deep Learning**: It's a subset of machine learning where neural networks with many layers learn from vast amounts of data.

10. **Gradient Boosting algorithms**:
    - GBM
    - XGBoost
    - LightGBM
    - CatBoost

11. **Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms**:
    - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
    - Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
    - Generalized Discriminant Analysis (GDA)

12. **Ensemble Algorithms**:
    - Random Forest
    - Gradient Boosting
    - AdaBoost
    - Stacking

13. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: They are mainly used for image processing, clustering, and classification.

14. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**: They are used for sequential data and time series data.

15. **Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTM)**: They are a type of RNN which are used for sequence prediction problems.

16. **Autoencoders**: They are a type of artificial neural network used for learning efficient codings of input data.

17. **Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM)**: They are used for dimensionality reduction, classification, regression, collaborative filtering, feature learning, and topic modelling.

18. **Self Organizing Maps (SOM)**: They are used for dimensionality reduction and for visualization.

19. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)**: They are used for generating new data that is similar to the input data.

20. **Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFN)**: They are used for function approximation and regression¹².

These algorithms are used in various applications such as image and object recognition, spam filtering, sentiment analysis, fraud detection, credit scoring, medical diagnosis, speech recognition, recommendation systems, weather forecasting, and stock price prediction²..
